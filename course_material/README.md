## C1 Neural Networks and Deep Learning
### W2A1
Python and ML basics 

### W2A2
build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats 

### W3A1
neural network with forward prop and backward prop which will have one hidden layer to classify a complex shape

### W4A1
week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! Previously you trained a 2-layer Neural Network with a single hidden layer. This week, you will build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want!

### W4A2
To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network.

## C2 Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

### W1A1
In this notebook, you'll try out a few different initializations and see how they lead to different results. 

### W1A2
apply L2 regularization and dropout to a deep learning model that recommends positions to football players. 

### W1A3
implement gradient checking to check for errors in your implementation of a fraud detection model. 

### W2A1
Optimization Methods: mini-batch, momentum, adam, learning_rate_decay

### W3A1
Use Tensorflow to classify hand gesture from 0-9(multi-classification)

## C3 Structuring Machine Learning Projects

## C4 Convolutional Neural Networks

### W1A1
Implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.
